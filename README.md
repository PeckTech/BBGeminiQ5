As with tbe OpenAI and Perplexity versions, it is using ECMAScript 5 (ES5), a version of JavaScript that’s much older than ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) but is widely supported by legacy browsers like the one on the BlackBerry Passport.

This does not only work on the BlackBerry devices, it will also work on standard web browser and I've been told it works well on legacy desktop devices that may struggle with modern web browsers.

You will need a Google Gemini API key which you can get from Google AI Studio. Note that the to obtain the AI key you have to associate it with a Google project that has a billing account associated with it. This is using the new Google Flash 2.0 LLM, probably one of the cheapest models that is available at the moment.
